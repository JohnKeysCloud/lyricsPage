Don’t lie to me
‘Cause I’m gonna know
All of these moves that you making
I’ve made them before 
We could’ve been less
But you said you loved me
I should’ve asked what that meant to you
But the way that you fucked me
Thought it could’ve been true 
But you was just bluffing
You was bluffing
I let you in, I feel like a dummy
Is this what you wanted (wanted)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tired of the same shit
This love thing, just ain’t it 
(We could’ve been less)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
How this shit played out
I’m feeling a way now 
We could’ve been less

Jaded, sip and get faded
Not much of a drinker, you know this 
To the time that I wasted 
Glass in the air 
Just to make you aware 
No, no, no, no      

Damn 
This shit is crazy
Only wanted the best for you
Fuck it
Cheers
